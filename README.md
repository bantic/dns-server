# DNS Server

Attempting to create a DNS server as part of a Recurse Center workshop.

## Sample Data

`query_packet.txt` is a DNS Query packet for an A record for google.com
`response_packet.txt` is the DNS Response packet for the response to the query, from 8.8.8.8

Both generated as described by https://github.com/EmilHernvall/dnsguide/blob/master/chapter1.md:

query packet:

- `nc -u -l 1053 > query_packet.txt` in one window, then
- `dig +retry=0 -p 1053 @127.0.0.1 +noedns google.com` in another. It will time out but will put the data into `query_packet.txt`

response packet:

- `nc -u 8.8.8.8 53 < query_packet.txt > response_packet.txt`. Give it a moment, then cancel the process. The response will be in `response_packet.txt`

## Running/Testing Locally

Confirm that the sample packets can be decoded:

```
$ node debug-packet query_packet.txt
====== Header =====
id 56802 (0xdde2), qr QUERY, opcode "QUERY"
aa 0, tc 0, rd 1, ra 0, z 0, AD 1, CD 0, rcode "No error"
qdcount 1, ancount 0, nscount 0, arcount 0
====== /Header ======

====== 1 Queries ======

        ====== Query 1 of 1 =====
        QNAME google.com, qtype A, qclass IN
        ====== /Query 1 of 1 =====

===== 0 Records =======

$ node debug-packet response_packet.txt
====== Header =====
id 56802 (0xdde2), qr QUERY, opcode "QUERY"
aa 0, tc 0, rd 1, ra 1, z 0, AD 0, CD 0, rcode "No error"
qdcount 1, ancount 1, nscount 0, arcount 0
====== /Header ======

====== 1 Queries ======

        ====== Query 1 of 1 =====
        QNAME google.com, qtype A, qclass IN
        ====== /Query 1 of 1 =====

===== 1 Records =======
        ====== Record 1 of 1 =====
        NAME "google.com" A IN 299
RDATA: {"domain":"google.com","host":"172.217.10.142"}
        ====== /Record 1 of 1 =====
```

Or try running the server and sending it a request via dig:

```
$ node server.js

// Separate terminal
$ dig @localhost -p 2222 +noedns recurse.com

// Server should print out the decoded query packet
```

### Files

- samples/\* -- sample binary packets to use for debugging

### TODOs

- Figure out what goes wrong when decoding the sample packet
- Add decoding for more data types (only "A" type is currently decoded)

### Done TODOS

- Ensure that sending a hardcoded Dns query packet to a known resolver (e.g., 8.8.8.8) is understood and returns a valid response
  ^ Working on this. Not getting any response. It seems like the packet is wrong.
  I tried sending the "query*packet.txt" packet (by hardcoding its bytes into the debug-send-query.js script) and it \_does*
  get a response. See TODO notes in debug-send-query about what to fix.
  The solution was to fix an error in the `toByte` function.
